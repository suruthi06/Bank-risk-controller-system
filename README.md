## Bank Risk Controller System with Automated Dashboard  
## Introduction  
This project is focused on building an automated system to monitor and control bank risk factors, integrated with a dynamic dashboard for real-time insights. The goal is to streamline risk assessment processes using Python-based data analysis and visualization tools.


## Skills Takeaway:  
-> Python scripting
-> Data extraction and preprocessing
-> Risk scoring algorithm development
-> Dynamic dashboard using Streamlit
-> Real-time risk insights

## Overview    
## Data Collection and Processing:   
Automate the extraction of financial and operational data, focusing on risk indicators, including:
-> Credit risk metrics
-> Market risk exposure
-> Operational risks
-> Liquidity ratios
-> Customer behavior analytics

## Dynamic Filtering:   
Develop a dashboard with intuitive filters, allowing users to explore risk metrics by department, branch, risk type, or time period.

## Risk Scoring Algorithm:  
Build and implement algorithms for assessing creditworthiness, liquidity risk, and market risk. Generate comprehensive risk scores.

Data Storage:
Store the processed data in structured formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, or databases). For large-scale operations, integrate with MySQL to enable fast data querying.

Data Analysis and Visualization:
Streamlit Dashboard:
-> Create an interactive dashboard to visualize risk metrics.
-> Provide insights through charts, tables, and heatmaps.

Real-time Updates:
-> Enable users to input parameters dynamically and get instant updates on risk exposure.
-> Display risk trends, aggregations, and potential red flags.

Data Analysis:
-> Analyze risk exposure per branch or department.
-> Identify trends such as the most common credit risks or periods of high market volatility.

Technology and Tools:
-> Python
-> Streamlit (for interactive dashboards)
-> MySQL (optional, for large datasets)
-> Pandas (for data manipulation)
-> Scikit-learn (optional, for machine learning-based risk scoring models)
-> Matplotlib/Plotly (for visualizations)

Packages and Libraries:
-> Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

import pandas as pd
-> Streamlit: For creating the dashboard.

import streamlit as st
-> MySQL Connector: For database integration.

import mysql.connector
-> Matplotlib/Plotly: For visualizing complex risk data.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
-> Scikit-learn: For building predictive models for risk assessment (optional).

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
Features:
Risk Monitoring:
-> Collect, preprocess, and analyze key risk indicators.
-> Build algorithms to calculate overall risk scores.

Dynamic Filtering:
-> Filter risk metrics by:

Department/Branch
Risk type (credit, operational, market)
Timeframe
Interactive Visualization:
-> Display metrics as tables, graphs, and heatmaps.
-> Highlight high-risk areas dynamically based on input.

Usage:
Risk Assessment:
-> Input key parameters or datasets.
-> Automate calculations of risk scores and generate a comprehensive report.

Dynamic Dashboard:
-> Use the sidebar to apply filters for branch, risk type, or timeframe.
-> Visualize results through charts and heatmaps.

Insights Generation:
-> Analyze high-risk areas to prioritize mitigation strategies.
-> Monitor trends to preemptively address emerging risks.
